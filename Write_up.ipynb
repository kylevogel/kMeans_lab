    "Well Mr. Rooney, after working through the lab, I finished the report you asked for on best valued NBA players you should look into. These are players who statistically perform better than their peers for the salaries that they have, and would provide substantially more value to your team for a cheaper amount. Before I tell you exactly who those players are, I want to walk you through the main steps of how I came to this conclusion."

    "I started out with two datasets that were incomplete and had errors that I needed to fix before I could trust anything. This included extra weird characters around players’ names, rows where the player name wasn’t even there, and the biggest issue which was players showing up multiple times because they were traded and played for multiple teams. To solve that, I cleaned the player name column so it would match correctly across the two datasets, removed the rows where the player name was missing, and then for traded players I only kept the stats from the team they played the most games for. That way, every player only showed up once, and it represented their main role for the season.\n",

    "On the salary side, the file loaded in a weird format where the header information was mixed into the data and the columns were labeled as “Unnamed.” I fixed the column names and dropped the first row so that the salary data was clean. Then I converted salary from a string like “$70,732” into an actual numeric dollar amount.\n",

    "After both datasets were cleaned, I merged them into one dataset using the player name as the join key, so every player had both stats and salary in the same row."

The whole point of this step is that it doesn’t make sense to compare a low minute bench player to a high minute starter.

    "After running KMeans, I evaluated the clustering using two checks. I used silhouette score to see how clean and separated the clusters were, and I also used inertia through the elbow method to see when adding more clusters stopped improving things by much. The elbow looked around 3, but 4 gave me slightly cleaner separation (with a higher silhouette) while still keeping the results easy to interpret, so I went with 4 clusters. It also gave me tighter clusters than 3 (lower inertia) and slightly better separation (higher silhouette). One thing that is a point of emphasis in clustering is that it is not saying one player is “good” or “bad.” It is just grouping players who look statistically similar. That matters because it lets me compare salary in a fair way. For example, it would not be fair to compare a bench player to a full time starter, since their roles and minutes are totally different. The clustering here helps create better comparisons."

So I would treat this as a shortlist of names to research further, not a final answer by itself."
